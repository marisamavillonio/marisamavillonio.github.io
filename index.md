## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Economics of the University of Pisa.

My research is in Alternative Finance, i.e. Crowdfunding, and in  Applied Machine Learning, with a focus on Natural Language Processing.
My goal is to transform Soft Information into data.
Therefore, I will combine econometric techniques as well as ML algorithms to extract knowledge from both semi-structured and unstructured textual data.


I earned a Master’s Degree (Hons.) in Financial Markets and Finance, in October 2019.
Afterwards I won a fellowship at the Sant’ Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, on the application of statistical analysis to health care data.
